\f0\fs24 \cf0 Average node degree is 1.100. \
The diameter of the graph is 6.\
The average path length is 4.00593947125948.\
The graph density is 0.002.\

The average node degree may represents the average number of edges connected to the node. From the graph, we could see that the edges per node is approximately 1. The diameter of the graph means the maximum eccentricity of any vertex/node in the graph, which is the longest shortest path\'92s number of edges. The average path length is the average number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes. The graph density describes how dense of a graph. For example, if the density is 1, the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges, whereas a graph with density 0 is with no edges.}
